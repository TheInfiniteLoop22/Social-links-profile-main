##   Hello World! My First Social Links Page 

This repository holds the code for my very first social links profile page! It's a basic setup using HTML and CSS to showcase my presence on various online platforms. 

***What's Inside?***

* `Week1-Task.html`: This is the main file that builds the structure and content of the page.
* `Week1-Task.css`: This file controls the visual presentation of the page, like colors, fonts, and layout.


***Feel free to explore and customize!***

This is a basic foundation, so feel free to play around with the code. Here are some ideas:

* Change the colors in `style.css` to match your style.
* Add or remove social media links as needed.
* Modify the layout and design to create a unique look and feel.

***I'd Love To learn Further!***

This project is a stepping stone for me in the world of web development.
If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to leave a comment below (if using a fork) or open an issue on this repository!


***Additional Notes:***

* This page was built using HTML and CSS.
* This is my first attempt at creating a social links page, so your feedback is highly appreciated!


I hope you find my first project interesting!
